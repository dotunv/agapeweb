## Testing Approach

The Agape subscription management system follows a comprehensive testing approach that combines automated and manual testing to ensure the highest quality of the application. Our testing strategy is based on the following principles:

- **Shift Left**: Testing begins early in the development process
- **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests than integration tests, more integration tests than end-to-end tests
- **Continuous Testing**: Tests are run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Critical components receive more thorough testing
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before implementing features when appropriate

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components (functions, methods, classes) work correctly in isolation. They should be:

- Fast to execute
- Independent of external systems
- Focused on a single unit of functionality
- Comprehensive in covering edge cases

Example unit test:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from users.models import User

class UserModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_generate_referral_code(self):
        user = User(username="testuser", email="test@example.com")
        referral_code = user.generate_referral_code()
        
        # Verify the referral code format
        self.assertEqual(len(referral_code), 10)
        self.assertTrue(referral_code.isupper() or referral_code.isdigit())
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work correctly together. They test:

- Interactions between multiple units
- Database operations
- API endpoints
- External service integrations

Example integration test:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework.test import APIClient
from users.models import User

class SubscriptionAPITest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username="testuser",
            email="test@example.com",
            password="testpassword123"
        )
        self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.user)
        
    def test_create_subscription(self):
        url = reverse('subscription-list')
        data = {
            'plan': 1,
            'auto_renew': True
        }
        response = self.client.post(url, data, format='json')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)
        self.assertEqual(response.data['user'], self.user.id)
        self.assertEqual(response.data['plan'], 1)
```

### Functional Tests

Functional tests verify that the application meets the functional requirements. They test:

- User workflows
- Business logic
- Feature completeness
- UI/UX functionality

Example functional test:

```python
from django.test import LiveServerTestCase
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

class SubscriptionWorkflowTest(LiveServerTestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Chrome()
        
    def tearDown(self):
        self.browser.quit()
        
    def test_subscription_purchase_workflow(self):
        # Navigate to login page
        self.browser.get(f'{self.live_server_url}/login/')
        
        # Log in
        self.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_username').send_keys('testuser')
        self.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'id_password').send_keys('testpassword123')
        self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'button[type="submit"]').click()
        
        # Navigate to subscription plans
        self.browser.get(f'{self.live_server_url}/plans/')
        
        # Select a plan
        self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '.plan-card:first-child .subscribe-button').click()
        
        # Confirm subscription
        self.browser.find_element(By.ID, 'confirm-subscription').click()
        
        # Verify success message
        success_message = self.browser.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, '.alert-success').text
        self.assertIn('Subscription created successfully', success_message)
```

### Security Tests

Security tests verify that the application is secure against common vulnerabilities. They test:

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- Data protection
- Security headers
- Dependency vulnerabilities

Example security test:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from rest_framework.test import APIClient

class SecurityTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = APIClient()
        
    def test_csrf_protection(self):
        # Attempt to submit a form without CSRF token
        url = reverse('login')
        data = {
            'username': 'testuser',
            'password': 'testpassword123'
        }
        response = self.client.post(url, data)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)  # Should be forbidden
        
    def test_auth_required_endpoints(self):
        # Attempt to access protected endpoint without authentication
        url = reverse('subscription-list')
        response = self.client.get(url)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 401)  # Should require authentication
```

### Performance Tests

   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

3. Configure test settings:
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=agape.settings.test
   # Or on Windows:
   # set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=agape.settings.test
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   # Or with pytest:
   pytest
   ```

### CI Testing Environment

The CI testing environment is configured in the GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). It includes:

- Multiple Python versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
- PostgreSQL database for integration tests
- Caching of dependencies to speed up builds
- Parallel test execution
- Code coverage reporting

## Writing Effective Tests

### Test Structure

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the test data and conditions
2. **Act**: Perform the action being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results

Example:

```python
def test_withdrawal_approval(self):
    # Arrange
    user = User.objects.create_user(username="testuser", email="test@example.com")
    wallet = Wallet.objects.create(user=user, balance=Decimal("100.00"))
    transaction = Transaction.objects.create(
        user=user,
        transaction_type="WITHDRAWAL",
        amount=Decimal("50.00"),
        status="PENDING"
    )
    withdrawal = Withdrawal.objects.create(
        user=user,
        amount=Decimal("50.00"),
        status="PENDING",
        transaction=transaction,
        wallet=wallet
    )
    
    # Act
    withdrawal.approve()
    
    # Assert
    withdrawal.refresh_from_db()
    transaction.refresh_from_db()
    wallet.refresh_from_db()
    
    self.assertEqual(withdrawal.status, "APPROVED")
    self.assertEqual(transaction.status, "COMPLETED")
    self.assertIsNotNone(withdrawal.processed_at)
```

### Test Naming

Use descriptive test names that indicate:
- What is being tested
- Under what conditions
- What the expected outcome is

Example: `test_withdrawal_approval_reduces_wallet_balance`

### Test Independence

Ensure each test is independent:
- Tests should not depend on the order of execution
- Tests should not depend on the state from other tests
- Use setUp and tearDown methods to create and clean up test data

### Test Data

Create realistic test data:
- Use factory_boy or similar tools to generate test data
- Cover edge cases and boundary conditions
- Use realistic values that match production scenarios

### Mocking External Services

Mock external services to isolate tests:
- Use unittest.mock or pytest monkeypatch
- Mock only what is necessary
- Verify that mocks are called correctly

Example:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('subscriptions.services.payment_gateway.process_payment')
def test_subscription_payment(self, mock_process_payment):
    # Configure the mock
    mock_process_payment.return_value = {'status': 'success', 'transaction_id': '123456'}
    
    # Test code that uses the payment gateway
    result = subscription.process_payment(amount=Decimal("50.00"))
    
    # Verify the mock was called correctly
    mock_process_payment.assert_called_once_with(
        user_id=subscription.user.id,
        amount=Decimal("50.00")
    )
    
    # Verify the result
    self.assertTrue(result)
```

## Test Coverage

### Measuring Coverage

Use Coverage.py to measure test coverage:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test

# Generate coverage report
coverage report

# Generate HTML coverage report
coverage html
```

### Coverage Targets

The Agape project aims for the following coverage targets:

- **Overall coverage**: At least 80%
- **Models**: At least 90%
- **Views/ViewSets**: At least 85%
- **Serializers**: At least 85%
- **Business logic**: At least 90%
- **Utility functions**: At least 80%

### Improving Coverage

To improve test coverage:

1. Identify uncovered code using the coverage report
2. Focus on critical paths and business logic first
3. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
4. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline runs the following steps:

1. **Checkout code**: Get the latest code from the repository
2. **Set up Python**: Install the required Python version
3. **Install dependencies**: Install all required packages
4. **Lint code**: Run flake8 to check code style
5. **Security scan**: Check for security vulnerabilities
6. **Run tests**: Execute all tests
7. **Measure coverage**: Generate coverage report
8. **Upload artifacts**: Store test results and coverage reports

### CI Best Practices

- Keep the CI pipeline fast (under 10 minutes)
- Fix failing tests immediately
- Don't commit code that breaks the build
- Review coverage reports regularly
- Set up notifications for build failures

## Manual Testing Procedures

While automated tests cover most functionality, some aspects require manual testing:

### User Interface Testing

1. **Visual inspection**: Verify that UI elements are displayed correctly
2. **Responsive design**: Test on different screen sizes
3. **Browser compatibility**: Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
4. **Accessibility**: Verify that the application is accessible to users with disabilities

### User Experience Testing

1. **Workflow testing**: Verify that user workflows are intuitive
2. **Error handling**: Verify that error messages are clear and helpful
3. **Performance perception**: Verify that the application feels responsive

### Integration Testing

1. **Third-party services**: Verify integration with payment gateways, email services, etc.
2. **API consumers**: Verify that API endpoints work correctly with frontend applications

## Regression Testing

### Regression Test Suite

The regression test suite includes:

1. **Critical path tests**: Tests for core functionality
2. **Previously fixed bugs**: Tests that verify fixed bugs don't reoccur
3. **High-risk areas**: Tests for areas that are prone to breakage

### When to Run Regression Tests

Run regression tests:

1. Before each release
2. After major changes to the codebase
3. After fixing critical bugs
4. Periodically (e.g., weekly) to catch regressions early

## Performance Testing

### Performance Test Scenarios
