## System Overview

The Agape subscription management system is built using a modern, API-first architecture based on Django and Django REST Framework. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

### High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture](images/high_level_architecture.png)

*Note: In this diagram, you would see the main components of the system, including the frontend applications, API layer, business logic layer, data access layer, and external integrations.*

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Frontend applications (web, mobile) and API endpoints
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Core application logic, services, and workflows
3. **Data Access Layer**: Models, repositories, and database interactions
4. **External Integration Layer**: Integrations with third-party services

### Key Components

- **Users**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profiles
- **Subscriptions**: Handles subscription plans, user subscriptions, and queues
- **Transactions**: Processes financial transactions and withdrawal requests
- **Core**: Provides shared functionality across the system

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

![Core Components](images/core_components.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the main components of the system and their relationships.*

#### Users Component

The Users component is responsible for:

- User registration and authentication
- User profile management
- Referral management
- Wallet management

Key classes:
- `User`: Custom user model extending Django's AbstractUser
- `UserViewSet`: API endpoints for user management
- `AuthenticationService`: Handles user authentication

#### Subscriptions Component

The Subscriptions component is responsible for:

- Subscription plan management
- User subscription management
- Queue management
- Contribution processing

Key classes:
- `Plan`: Represents subscription plans
- `Subscription`: Represents user subscriptions
- `Queue`: Manages the subscription queue
- `Contribution`: Tracks contributions between subscriptions
- `Wallet`: Manages user wallets
- `Referral`: Handles referral relationships and bonuses

#### Transactions Component

The Transactions component is responsible for:

- Transaction processing
- Withdrawal management
- Financial record keeping

Key classes:
- `Transaction`: Represents financial transactions
- `Withdrawal`: Handles withdrawal requests
- `TransactionService`: Processes transactions

#### Core Component

The Core component provides:

- Shared utilities and helpers
- System-wide settings
- Health checks and monitoring

Key classes:
- `HealthCheckView`: API endpoint for system health monitoring
- `Utilities`: Common utility functions

### Component Interactions

![Component Interactions](images/component_interactions.png)

*Note: This diagram would show how the different components interact with each other.*

Key interactions:

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users component creates a new user account
   - Subscriptions component creates default wallets for the user
   - If referred, Referral model tracks the referral relationship

2. **Subscription Creation**:
   - User requests a subscription
   - Subscription component creates a subscription
   - Queue component adds the subscription to the appropriate queue
   - Transaction component records the payment

3. **Withdrawal Process**:
   - User requests a withdrawal
   - Transaction component creates a withdrawal request
   - Admin approves or rejects the withdrawal
   - Transaction component updates the user's wallet

## Data Flow Diagrams

### User Registration Flow

![User Registration Flow](images/user_registration_flow.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the data flow during user registration.*

1. User submits registration information
2. System validates the information
3. System creates a user account
4. System creates default wallets for the user
5. System sends a welcome email
6. System returns a success response with authentication token

### Subscription Purchase Flow

![Subscription Purchase Flow](images/subscription_purchase_flow.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the data flow during subscription purchase.*

1. User selects a subscription plan
2. System validates the user's eligibility
3. System processes the payment
4. System creates a subscription
5. System adds the subscription to the queue
6. System returns a success response with subscription details

### Withdrawal Request Flow

![Withdrawal Request Flow](images/withdrawal_request_flow.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the data flow during withdrawal request processing.*

1. User submits a withdrawal request
2. System validates the request
3. System creates a withdrawal record
4. Admin reviews the withdrawal request
5. Admin approves or rejects the request
6. System processes the withdrawal
7. System updates the user's wallet
8. System notifies the user of the withdrawal status

## Database Schema

The database schema is documented in detail in the [Database Schema and Relationships](../database/README.md) document. Below is a high-level entity relationship diagram:

![Entity Relationship Diagram](images/entity_relationship_diagram.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the main entities in the database and their relationships.*

Key entities:

- **User**: Represents a user in the system
- **Plan**: Represents a subscription plan
- **Subscription**: Represents a user's subscription to a plan
- **Queue**: Represents a subscription's position in the queue
- **Contribution**: Represents a contribution from one subscription to another
- **Wallet**: Represents a user's wallet for a specific plan
- **Transaction**: Represents a financial transaction
- **Withdrawal**: Represents a withdrawal request

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Environment

![Production Deployment](images/production_deployment.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the deployment architecture for the production environment.*

The production environment consists of:

1. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across application servers
2. **Application Servers**: Run the Django application
3. **Database Server**: PostgreSQL database
4. **Cache Server**: Redis for caching
5. **Static File Server**: Serves static files
6. **Media File Server**: Serves user-uploaded files
7. **Background Worker**: Processes asynchronous tasks
8. **Monitoring Server**: Collects and displays metrics

### Development Environment

![Development Deployment](images/development_deployment.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the deployment architecture for the development environment.*

The development environment consists of:

1. **Local Development Server**: Django development server
2. **Local Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL
3. **Local Cache**: In-memory cache or Redis
4. **Local File Storage**: Local file system

### Staging Environment

![Staging Deployment](images/staging_deployment.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the deployment architecture for the staging environment.*

The staging environment mirrors the production environment but with reduced resources:

1. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across application servers
2. **Application Server**: Runs the Django application
3. **Database Server**: PostgreSQL database
4. **Cache Server**: Redis for caching
5. **Static File Server**: Serves static files
6. **Media File Server**: Serves user-uploaded files
7. **Background Worker**: Processes asynchronous tasks
8. **Monitoring Server**: Collects and displays metrics

## Security Architecture

![Security Architecture](images/security_architecture.png)

*Note: This diagram would show the security architecture of the system.*

The security architecture includes:

1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Protects against common web attacks
2. **HTTPS**: Encrypts all traffic between clients and servers
3. **Authentication**: Verifies user identity
4. **Authorization**: Controls access to resources
5. **Data Encryption**: Protects sensitive data
6. **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks
7. **Audit Logging**: Records security-relevant events
8. **Intrusion Detection**: Identifies potential security breaches

For more details on security practices and policies, see the [Security Practices and Policies](../security/README.md) document.

## Integration Architecture

![Integration Architecture](images/integration_architecture.png)

*Note: This diagram would show how the system integrates with external services.*

The system integrates with the following external services:

1. **Payment Gateways**: For processing payments
2. **Email Service**: For sending emails
3. **SMS Service**: For sending SMS notifications
4. **Google OAuth**: For authentication
5. **Analytics Service**: For tracking user behavior
6. **Monitoring Service**: For system monitoring
