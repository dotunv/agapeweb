## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

The Agape system implements multiple authentication methods to ensure secure user access:

- **Email/Password Authentication**: Standard authentication using email and password
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure token-based authentication for API access
- **Google OAuth**: Third-party authentication using Google accounts
- **Knox Tokens**: Secure token management for session handling

Password requirements:

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Passwords are never stored in plain text, only as secure hashes
- Password reset functionality requires email verification

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

For enhanced security, the system supports multi-factor authentication:

- Optional for regular users
- Required for administrators and users with elevated privileges
- Supports authentication apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Fallback to SMS verification when necessary

### Authorization

The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

- **Regular Users**: Can manage their own subscriptions and transactions
- **Subscription Managers**: Can manage subscription plans and user subscriptions
- **Financial Administrators**: Can approve/reject withdrawals and manage transactions
- **System Administrators**: Have full access to all system functions

Permissions are granular and can be customized for specific roles.

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

The system implements the following practices for handling sensitive data:

- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**: Stored with appropriate access controls
- **Financial Information**: Encrypted both in transit and at rest
- **Authentication Credentials**: Stored using secure hashing algorithms (Argon2)
- **API Keys and Secrets**: Stored in environment variables, never in code repositories

### Encryption

Data encryption is implemented at multiple levels:

- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: All HTTP traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.2+
- **Database Encryption**: Sensitive fields are encrypted in the database
- **File Encryption**: Uploaded files are encrypted before storage
- **Key Management**: Encryption keys are rotated regularly and stored securely

### Data Retention and Deletion

The system follows these data retention policies:

- User data is retained only as long as necessary for business purposes
- Inactive accounts are archived after 12 months of inactivity
- Users can request data export and deletion (GDPR compliance)
- Automated data purging for non-essential data after retention period

## API Security

### API Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using one of the following methods:

- JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- API keys for service-to-service communication
- OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations

### Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and DoS attacks, the API implements rate limiting:

- IP-based rate limiting for public endpoints
- Token-based rate limiting for authenticated requests
- Graduated rate limits based on user role and subscription level
- Automatic blocking of IPs that exceed rate limits repeatedly

### Input Validation

All API inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks:

- Schema validation for all request payloads
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Parameterized queries for database operations
- Content-Type validation

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow only specific origins:

- Frontend application domains
- Trusted third-party integrations
- Localhost for development purposes

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Hardening

All servers are hardened according to industry best practices:

- Regular security updates and patches
- Minimal installed packages
- Firewall configuration with default-deny policy
- SSH access with key-based authentication only
- Disabled root login

### Network Security

Network security measures include:

- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for isolation
- Network ACLs and security groups
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for public-facing components
- DDoS protection
- Internal services not exposed to the public internet

### Database Security

Database security measures include:

- Access limited to application servers only
- Strong authentication credentials
- Regular security patches
- Encrypted backups
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations

### Secrets Management

Secrets are managed securely using:

- Environment variables for runtime secrets
- Vault or similar service for storing and rotating secrets
- CI/CD pipeline integration for secure deployment
- No hardcoded secrets in code or configuration files

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Auditing

The system implements comprehensive logging:

- Authentication events (successful and failed attempts)
- Administrative actions
- Data modifications
- API access
- System errors and exceptions

Logs are:
- Centralized in a secure logging system
- Retained for at least 90 days
- Protected against tampering
- Regularly reviewed for security incidents

### Intrusion Detection

The system uses multiple methods for intrusion detection:

- Anomaly detection for unusual user behavior
- Monitoring for known attack patterns
- Alerting for suspicious activities
- Regular security scans

### Vulnerability Management

The vulnerability management process includes:

- Regular automated security scans
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Manual penetration testing
- Bug bounty program
- Prompt patching of identified vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

In case of a security incident:

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm the security incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Review the incident and improve security measures

### Breach Notification

In case of a data breach:

- Affected users will be notified within 72 hours
- Relevant authorities will be informed as required by law
- Clear information about the breach and its impact will be provided
- Steps to mitigate potential harm will be communicated

## Compliance

### Regulatory Compliance

The Agape system is designed to comply with relevant regulations:

- **GDPR**: For handling personal data of EU residents
- **PCI DSS**: For handling payment information
- **CCPA**: For California residents' privacy rights
- **Local data protection laws**: As applicable in operating jurisdictions

### Security Standards

The system follows industry security standards:

- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- SANS Critical Security Controls
- ISO 27001 security framework
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Security Assessments

Regular security assessments are conducted:

- Annual third-party security audits
- Quarterly internal security reviews
- Continuous automated security testing
- Compliance verification

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

Developers should follow these security best practices:

- Follow the secure coding guidelines in the [Developer Onboarding Guide](../development/README.md)
- Use the principle of least privilege when designing features
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Keep dependencies updated and free from known vulnerabilities
- Participate in security code reviews

### For Administrators

Administrators should follow these security best practices:

- Use strong, unique passwords and enable MFA
- Regularly review user access and permissions
- Monitor security logs and alerts
- Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access
- Keep the system updated with security patches
- Regularly backup data and test restoration procedures

### For Users

Users should be encouraged to:

- Use strong, unique passwords
